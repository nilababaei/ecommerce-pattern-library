{{include.text-main}} | Because of its high iron content, the Hematite crystal stone meaning is associated with the ancient Greeks who used powdered Hematite to make a red pigment. Because of its intense blood-like shade when mixed with water, the Greeks named it 'haima,' the Latin word for blood. This mysterious stone with a silvery sheen is linked with the silver color ray, the shaded moonlight that mesmerizes with its bright and clear iridescence.
