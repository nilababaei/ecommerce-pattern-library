{{include.text-main}} | Derived from the French word citron, meaning lemon, this crystalâ€™s vibe is anything but sour! Sweet is the essence of this fortune-flourishing gem. Used in the jewelry of Greek and Roman civilizations dating back to the 1st century A.D., Citrine has long been remarked for its subtle, honeyed beauty.
