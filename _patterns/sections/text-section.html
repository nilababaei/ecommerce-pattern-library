      <p class="push-1-2 p-col"><small>Crystals are beautiful rock formations that have amazed humans for thousands of years. They are used for many different things, not just for decoration. Many of the first radios ever invented used crystals to transmit the radio waves. Some watches, like quartz watches, still use crystals to this day. They have always been viewed as something of beauty and are still often placed with diamonds or other stones inside pieces of jewelry.</small></p>
      <p class="push-1-2 p-col"><small>Crystals are nothing more than an established batch of molecules or atoms. Crystals come in many different shapes and sizes, and each one has different characteristics. What they are made of determines how it will form.</small></p>
      <p class="push-1-2 p-col"><small>Crystals harness the life giving elements of the Earth and the universe. Harnessing the energy of the Sun, the Moon, and the oceans, semi-precious stones connect us to Earth as soon as we come into contact with them. Many people wonder if crystals have healing powers, and while there are many anecdotes describing the curative effects of healing stones, it really depends on your own experience. It takes a conscious effort to open your heart and mind to the power of crystal healing, butonce you begin, the journey is studded with beautiful, mysterious, and unique crystals that will rock your world.</small></p>
